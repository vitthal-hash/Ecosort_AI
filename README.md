# ♻️ EcoSort AI – Intelligent Waste Detection & Smart Sorting System

> AI-powered waste management platform that detects, classifies, and guides waste disposal in real time using Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models.

---

# 📌 Overview

EcoSort AI is a full-stack AI application designed to improve waste segregation through real-time object detection and intelligent disposal guidance.

The system combines a custom-trained YOLOv8 model with an LLM-powered assistant to help users:
- identify waste categories,
- validate detections,
- receive smart disposal recommendations,
- track environmental impact,
- and maintain personal waste management statistics.

EcoSort AI supports both **live camera detection** and **image upload-based detection**, making the platform flexible and accessible across different use cases.
